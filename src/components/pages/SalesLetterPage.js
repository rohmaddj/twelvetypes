            <p>
              You’ve experienced the thrill of discovering your personality archetypes; coming face-to-face with the
              intimate reality of your most authentic self.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s exciting, isn’t it? Comforting to know that there might be others like you, and rewarding to have
              your craving for connection satisfied.
            </p>
            <p>You’ve come to understand why you learn, behave, act, and react in certain ways.</p>
            <p>{this.state.content.s2}</p>
            <p>
              Because you’re on a different path, comprising different motivations, with your own unique sense of
              achievement, and a profound sense of purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some say that personalities are malleable, while others believe that a leopard never changes its spots.
              Really, what’s true, and what’s not?
            </p>
            <p>Is it one or the other? A combination of both?</p>
            <p>Or maybe it’s something else.</p>
            <p>
              Point being, personalities are something else entirely. You might be able to change your spots, but in any
              case, you don’t have to!
            </p>
            <p>
              As unsatisfying as that answer sounds, there’s so much complexity in the human mind, body, and spirit that
              there’s almost never a definitive answer to these types of questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              And that admittance is really what sets archetypes apart - it doesn’t seek to change you, but to help you
              evolve and become a happier, wiser, more confident, and more fulfilled version of you.

            <p>
              There’s much more you wish to achieve, and there’s no telling just how bright and beautiful your future
              can become.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like a blossoming flower, imagine unfurling into the most ideal version of you. What would it look like?
              How would you feel? Would you…
            </p>
            <p>Reflect upon yourself with more kindness than distaste?</p>
            <p>Make remarkable progress on the passions you wish to pursue?</p>
            <p>
              Celebrate your newfound sense of confidence and freedom of expression? Feel more deeply connected with the
              ones you love?
            </p>
            <p>
              But you already know that merely entertaining the thought and working towards that evolution are
              completely different.
            </p>
            <p>If only it were that simple, right?</p>
            <p>Well, it can be…</p>
            <p>
              See, in your subconscious, you’re already aware that the only pre-requisite for becoming more like you, is
              to stop trying to become like anyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
              No matter how hard you try to stray away from the expectations of others, no matter how hard you remain
              resilient to the pressures to become who you feel like you’re not - you find yourself gradually
              transforming into things you told yourself not to become.
            </p>
            <p>The things you remember telling yourself, “that’s not me”.</p>
            <p>
              Perhaps our childish adolescence is a better expression of who we truly are; not our matured and developed
              selves.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s the harsh reality of life, isn’t it? Eternally struggling between fitting in and embracing that
              missing part of ourselves.

            <p>
              Self discovery sounds pretty daunting - it’s intimate; and opens you up to being vulnerable and exposed.

            <p>
              Beyond that, trying to unearth your hidden motivations and little-known characteristics can be super
              confusing. You could trial-and-error your way through, but it’s not going to be a bed of roses.
            </p>
            <p>Most (if not all) of us share relatively similar self-discovering struggles:</p>
            <div className="ui large bulleted list">

                Pursuing certain passions without being sure if they’re aligned to your purpose…

              No matter how old, how wise, how happy we are, same struggles of awkwardly fumbling our way through remain

              But - it doesn’t have to be that way. That’s why we look to archetypes. The original models of
