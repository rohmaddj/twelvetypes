                Greetings and welcome to TwelveTypes.com, a place where you can
                discover your true potential through our free personality test
                designed specifically to determine not only your specific
                archetype based on the Carl Jung personality test, but also on
                improving your personality traits.
            </p>
            <p>
                By deeply delving into your characteristics, you will be able to 
                discover your strengths and weaknesses, drastically improving your
                ability to adapt with the world around you, particularly on every
                important aspect of your life. This includes areas such as your
                personal growth, learning abilities, and interpersonal relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only does TwelveTypes.com offer you a detailed look into your undiscovered
                character traits, but we can also help you in finding more about
                yourself and what you can become by fully understanding other
                archetypes and how to fully deal with them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our main goal is to help you discover the “real” you that has
                the ability to become more than what you presently are right
                now, a whole new person, capable of accomplishing wonderful
                things, that is trapped between stagnation and success.
               </p>
              <p>
                We have prepared a personality type test that goes beyond pointing out
                your true inner character, but also gives you a better
                perspective on how to reach your goals in life by revealing the
                true potential of your respective archetype.
            </p>
             <p>
                Not only can you have a clearer sight of what lies beyond your destiny, but you
                will be able to take hold of your own destiny from the hands of
                fate and rule your life, the way that you want to.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we said before, our sole intention is to bring you out from
                your “inner shell”, that same shell of doubt and reluctance that
                is limiting you from encouraging you to to do your best in what
                you do and become what you want to be.
              </p>
              <p>
                Understand this when we say that we believe that everybody and we do mean everybody has
                a great potential lurking within them that needs to be brought
                out through positive nurturing and encouragement. One proven way
                to accomplish that is through discovering their “real” selves,
                in an unbiased and non-judgemental means of self-realization and
                acceptance.
            </p>
            <p>
                But to fully understand ourselves, means that we
                have to find out who we really are and why we behave in such a
                way so that we can learn to develop positive habits that you can
                use in our daily lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                The key in every question in life is understanding the right
                questions that you have to ask for yourself and that is “What do
                you really want your life to become?”.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is why
                TwelveTypes.com is here, to guide you towards achieving those
                specific questions, whether that be becoming a better person for
                others to see or conquering your self-doubts that are slowing
                you down from your specific goals in life, we are always here to
                give you an exponentially unique life-changing experience that
